Option B is a tapping noise with more repetitions, C is speech and dancing. D is sounds from sliding a door. Audio A appears to have a more natural scraping type rhythm. Audio A at least is a better choice than D because the repetition counts from door sliding seem random. Even so, None of the audio clips directly correspond to 24 in any way and none is described.
