Audio A seems to fit as it has a strong rhythm of around 9 beat-like sounds repeating at approximately the same rate that is represented in the spectrogram as repetitive bursts. None of the other audios, with their differing and/or irregular rhythms of repeating counts seem to match the repetition rate displayed in the spectrogram.",

These events seem to have strong energy at low frequencies around 200 Hz and also show some presence in mid frequencies. Audio B has 3 distinct events, which are hits of some kind.

The pattern repeats roughly every second. Sound A presents a series of tennis hits. The rate and frequency of these hits match the pattern displayed on the spectrogram. The other sounds show differences in the timing and frequency range of the recurring events compared to what's visible in the image, therefore A is the closest match.",
