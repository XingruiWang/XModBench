A lathe is a machine tool that rotates a workpiece on its axis to perform various operations such as cutting and shaping. Image B clearly shows a cylindrical workpiece mounted in a machine, spinning rapidly while a tool carves into it. This is a direct visual representation of a lathe in operation. In contrast, Image A shows a car on a road, Image C shows a man playing a double bass, and Image D shows popcorn popping in a machine. None of these other images depict a lathe.",
