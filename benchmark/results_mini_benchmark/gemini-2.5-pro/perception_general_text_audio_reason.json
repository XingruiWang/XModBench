            "response": "A",
            "reasoning": "The description is 'lathe spinning'. A lathe is a machine tool that produces a distinct motorized, whirring sound when rotating a workpiece. Clip A features a clear mechanical whirring that sounds like a motor spinning up, followed by a scraping/cutting noise, which is characteristic of a tool engaging with the material on a lathe. Clip B sounds more like a circular saw cutting. Clip C is a much lower-pitched, clunky mechanical sound, not the high-speed rotation of a lathe. Clip D is the sound of handling metal parts, not a machine in operation. Therefore, Clip A is the best match.",
