Image A shows a fly, which makes a buzzing sound. Image B shows elephants, which make trumpeting or stomping sounds. Image D shows a person using a typewriter, which produces a mechanical clacking noise. Image C, however, shows a person's hands in a position and motion consistent with playing a handheld percussion instrument like maracas. Therefore, the sound in the audio most likely belongs to the activity depicted in image C."
